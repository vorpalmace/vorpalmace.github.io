Mark your calendars for the 6th of May; that is the day when the [Backerkit campaign](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mythmere-games/osric-3/launch_party) for the new edition of OSRIC starts. In case you’ve been living under a rock, OSRIC is a damn fine retroclone of AD&D1e and also one of the founding fathers of the whole OSR movement. Given that it will turn 20 next year, I can’t imagine a better way to celebrate than releasing a newer, prettier, revised, more accessible edition.

One of the best things that happened to the OSR scene in recent years was Matt Finch’s breakup with Frog God Games[^1] and the glorious revival of Mythmere Games. All the classics they’ve revamped and all the new products they’ve released so far that I’ve seen have been top-notch[^2], and I have no doubt they will deliver again.

There is a neat summary on the [Mythmere Games website](https://www.mythmeregames.com/blogs/news/osric-3-0) about what to expect from the new edition. I don’t have anything to add other than that I’ve already read the first version of Whispers of the Death God, and it alone would be worth a crowdfunding campaign. So stay tuned, stay hyped, and I'll see you on the 6th!

[^1]: Who struggled so much with finding a new old-school platform that, in the end, they decided to release their own retroclone with blackjack and hookers.

[^2]: I did not read some of the modules, though, and I firmly believe they dropped the ball when they halved the number of skeletons in Tomb of the Iron God’s skeleton barracks.
