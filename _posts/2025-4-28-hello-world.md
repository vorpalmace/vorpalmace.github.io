Welcome to the new and improved Vorpal Mace blog!

Following a long break, I finally sat down to write a post on my [old blog](https://vorpalmace.blogspot.com/). I stared at Blogger's interface for a while, then said: "fuck this shit, it's time to move on". After exploring other options, I embraced my inner software developer and decided to cobble together my own trash heap using GitHub Pages.

I spent more time experimenting with styles, comment plugins, and web analytics platforms than I'm willing to admit before ending up with the current site. It's ugly, but it's mine. I'll keep tinkering with it whenever the mood strikes, so expect more changes in the future. To top it off, I bullied my dear friend Vesper[^1] into drawing me a logo, so I can truly feel special.

Just like its predecessor, the new Vorpal Mace blog is first and foremost a platform for my rants, reports, and reviews on tabletop rpgs. Given that my preference for old-school D&D and percentile systems has been steady for over a decade by now, expect most articles to focus on them.

As for the old blog, it's here to stay. While I won't be posting new content there, neither do I plan to delete it.

Fight On!
