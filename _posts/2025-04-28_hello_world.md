Welcome to the new and improved Vorpal Mace blog!

Following a long break, I finally sat down to write a post on my [old blog](https://vorpalmace.blogspot.com/). I stared at Blogger's interface for a while, then said "fuck this shit, it's time to move on". After exploring other options I embraced my inner software developer and decided to cobble together my own trash heap using GitHub Pages. I spent more time experimenting with styles, comment plugins, web analytics platforms than I'm willing to admit before I ended up with the current site. It's ugly, but it's mine. I'll keep tinkering with it whenever the mood strikes, so expect more changes in the future. To top it off, I bullied my dear friend Vesper into drawing me a logo, so I can truly feel special.

Just like its predecessor, Vorpal Mace II will be my platform for rants, reports, and reviews on tabletop rpgs. M
I'm still mostly interested in the various flavours of old-school D&D and percentile systems. Considering this has been the case for a while now, don't expect any deviations in the foreseeable future.

Fight On!
