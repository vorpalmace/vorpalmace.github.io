June starts strong with Kickstarter campaigns. Right on the coattails of [OSRIC](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mythmere-games/osric-3/) comes another big and important OSR project. Robert Conley has proven with his past works that he knows a thing or two about sandboxing, and now he is gathering funds to release his magnum opus, [The Northern Marches](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/batintheatticgames/into-the-majestic-fantasy-realms-the-northern-marches). If you need a setting with huge-ass hex maps or want to fill the Wilderlands-sized hole in your heart after giving up on Judges Guild, look no further.

If that wasn't enough, Free League is gathering funds for not one, but [two Dragonbane supplements](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/arkand-and-the-book-of-magic-for-the-acclaimed-dragonbane-rpg): the city book Arkand and the much-needed Magic Book. The campaign was funded in less than ten minutes and is plowing through its stretch goals as I'm writing these lines.

I hope June doesnâ€™t hold any more surprises. I also hope my kids are okay with eating dry bread for a while.
