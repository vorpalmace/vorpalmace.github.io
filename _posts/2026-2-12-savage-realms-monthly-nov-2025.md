By the end of last year, I realized that I hadn’t been reading much fiction lately, so I ordered a bunch of sword & sorcery and science fiction novels that will probably end up collecting dust once I lose momentum. While doing so, a thread popped up on Reddit’s r/SwordandSorcery sub, where Richard Fisher offered the first three responders a free issue of *Savage Realms Monthly*. All he asked in return was a review. Needless to say, I volunteered.

*Savage Realms Monthly* is “a collection of dark fantasy sword and sorcery short adventure stories” that started in January 2021. I’d heard the name before, but I hadn’t read a review or bought any issues yet. The latter is about to change, though, because the freebie I got was a damn fun ride from start to finish.

*Once Upon a Blood-Dark Sea* by Charles Gramlich revolves around Krieg, a taciturn warrior with a ridiculously metal name, whose sea journey is interrupted by the gradual emergence of a sunken island. The ancient ruins found on it leave the crew stupefied, but the reader will recognise their true nature… *Once Upon a Blood-Dark Sea* is a good old-fashioned sword & sorcery adventure mixed with a spoonful of post-apocalyptic and a hint of Lovecraftian horror. Gramlich’s writing is terse and efficient. Zero bullshit, no filler, all action. He knows how to tell a rip-roaring story at an insanely rapid pace.

*The Soldier and the Witch – The Dark Woods* by Seain Dunne follows the journey of the soldier Silas and the witch Malfey, who are on their way to the Old City in a dark realm fucked up by the Long War. After an intimate night, our protagonists enter a creepy forest inhabited by beastmen—and worse! *The Dark Woods* is my favorite short story from this issue. Dunne’s dark fantasy perfectly nails the atmosphere of the darker *Warhammer* stories from the eighties and nineties, which I adore. It is the second part in a series, but completely enjoyable on its own. Nevertheless, it made me buy the August 2025 issue so I can read the prequel. I’m eagerly looking forward to more The Soldier and the Witch stories.

*Marrow-Eater* by Josh Bartolome introduces the samurai Saburo and his retainers, who, after suffering a defeat in battle, visit an ancient castle to summon the yokai imprisoned within. They hope they can use the demon to their advantage, but as expected, things go south… Or not? This is the story I felt least invested in, until the supernatural reared its ugly head and turned the whole tale into a *Nioh/Sekiro* fanfic midway. Its slightly convoluted twist also warmed my anime-loving heart, and its ending feels like this is only the beginning of a longer arc.

I’m sold. The magazine might not feature Howard or Leiber, but it delivers three very different, competently written adventures. I really can’t say anything bad about it. Even the cover is cool. The print issue might seem pricey at $10.99, but $3.80 for the Kindle edition is a bargain for roughly 70 pages of quality entertainment.
