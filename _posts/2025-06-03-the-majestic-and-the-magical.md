June starts strong with Kickstarter campaign. Right on the coattails of [OSRIC](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mythmere-games/osric-3/) comes another big and important OSR project. Robert Conley proved with his past works that he knows a thing or two about sandboxing, and now he is gathering money to release his magnum opus, the [the Northern Marches](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/batintheatticgames/into-the-majestic-fantasy-realms-the-northern-marches). If you are in need of a setting with huge ass hex maps or want to fill the Wilderlands-sized hole in your heart after you have given up on Judges Guild, look no further.

If this wasn't enough, Free League is gathering money for not one, but [two Dragonbane supplements](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/arkand-and-the-book-of-magic-for-the-acclaimed-dragonbane-rpg): the city book Arkand and the much needed Magic Book. The campaign was funded in less than ten minutes and is plowing through its stretch goals as I'm writing these lines.

I really hope June doesn't hold any more surprises. I also hope my kids are okay with eating dry bread for a while. One day, when they will be selling my hoard they will be grateful.
